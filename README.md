Build a basic mini calculator that stores history
# Mini Calculator with History üßÆ

This is a Python-based command-line calculator that:
- Handles +, -, *, /, %, //, **
- Tracks all calculations in a session
- Supports 'clear' to reset history
- Exits cleanly with 'exit'

## How to Use
Run it in Google Colab or any Python IDE.  
Follow the prompts to calculate, clear, or exit.

## Why I Built This
This was Day 1 of my "15-Day Code Quest" to become hackathon and internship ready üíª‚öîÔ∏è

Built with ‚ô•Ô∏è by Shagun, the Coder Alchemist.
